            <h1>Matt's First Attempt With Plotly</h1>
            <!-- Plotly chart will be drawn inside this DIV -->
            <p>This is my first stab at Plotly. I am refering to <a href="https://github.com/Rainman21/PlotlyDemo">Ricks Demo.</a>
            This is my process so far. I looked up some data sets. I came across an "auto mpg set" that I found interesting. 
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/auto-mpg.csv">See here</a></p>

            <p>What I have done so far is understand how the Plotly.d3.csv pulls the data in and maps. Rick's demo leverages an array and 
                then plots everything. Mine is an array of objects. This took me quite some time to debug.</p>

            <p>So what I have done is only grabbed the first 5 objects. Once I understand this a little more I am going to try to plot the data relative to the fields  </p>
                <h4>Example Object</h4>
            <p> acceleration: "12"<br/>
                cylinders: "8"<br/>
                displacement: "307"<br/>
                horsepower: "130"<br/>
                model-year: "70"<br/>
                mpg: "18"<br/>
                weight: "3504"</p>
            <div id="mpg" style="width:100%;height:100%"></div>
            <script src="scripts/mpg.js"></script>
